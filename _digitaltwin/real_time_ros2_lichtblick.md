## Name
Real-Time ROS2 Lichtblick Visualizer

## Description

This component provides a Docker-based version of [Lichtblick](https://github.com/lichtblick-suite/lichtblick), adapted as a real-time visualization tool for robotics solutions based on ROS 2. It leverages the capabilities of [Foxglove](https://foxglove.dev/) to provide an intuitive and interactive interface for monitoring and analyzing robotic systems in real time.

### Features

- Dockerized deployment: Easy to set up and run in isolated environments without complex installation.
- Real-time visualization: Leverages Foxglove for monitoring live ROS 2 data streams (topics, transforms, logs, etc.).
- ROS 2 compatibility: Natively supports ROS 2 message types and tools for robotic system integration.
- 3D visualization: View robot models, environments, and sensor data (e.g., LIDAR, cameras) in an interactive 3D scene.
- Customizable panels: Flexible UI with panels for plotting, logging, time-series data, and more.
- Bag file playback support: Visualize and debug recorded `.db3` or `.mcap` data alongside live streams.
- Isolated environment: Ensures consistent behavior across different systems using containerization.
- Web-based interface: Access the visualization tool through a browser, no local GUI required.
- Multi-topic inspection: Subscribe to and inspect multiple ROS 2 topics in parallel.
- Easy configuration: Supports loading custom layouts and configurations at startup.

## Pilot
This component enables remote monitoring of all ROS2 topics in the pilot, allowing users to visualize dataâ€”whether textual, point clouds, images, or others, directly from a web browser. Additionally, it can be reused in any other pilot project that includes developments based on ROS.
