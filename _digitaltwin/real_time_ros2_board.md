## Name
Real-Time ROS2 Board

## Description

This component provides a web based visualization tool for ROS2 environments. It builds upon the original ROSboard (https://github.com/dheera/rosboard) project by adding project-specific visual branding and improving error handling during ROS2 message reception. These enhancements allow the component to log exceptions gracefully without interrupting data flow, increasing reliability during runtime.

## Features
- Web-based visualization of ROS1/ROS2 topics
- Mobile-friendly interface
- Lightweight and resource-efficient
- Compatible with live ROS nodes and ROS bag file playback
- Easily extensible with custom .js visualizations

## Pilot
This component enables remote monitoring of all ROS2 topics in the pilot, allowing users to visualize dataâ€”whether textual, point clouds, images, or others, directly from a web browser. Additionally, it can be reused in any other pilot project that includes developments based on ROS.
