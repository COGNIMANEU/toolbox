physicaltwin: 'The physical twin represents the actual physical object, process, or system within the real world. This layer includes physical machinery, equipment, devices, and any other tangible components that are part of the manufacturing environment. Sensors and actuators embedded in these physical assets collect real-time data, which serves as the basis for creating and updating the digital twin.'
digitaltwin: 'The heart of the architecture is the digital twin itself. This layer is a virtual representation of the physical twin, constructed using the real-time data collected from sensors and combined with relevant contextual information. The digital twin accurately mirrors the behaviour, characteristics, and conditions of its physical counterpart through modeling, such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), Graph based modeling, etc. It enables simulations, analysis, and monitoring, allowing for predictive insights and informed decision-making.'
datalayer: 'The data layer serves as the foundation for the entire digital twin ecosystem. It encompasses the collection, storage, and management of raw data generated by sensors and other data sources associated with the physical twin. This data can include measurements, sensor readings, operational parameters, environmental conditions, and more. Proper data processing and storage are crucial to ensure accurate and reliable digital twin representations.'
servicelayer: 'The service layer encapsulates the functionalities and services that leverage the capabilities of the digital twin. This layer includes various algorithms, models, simulations, and analytic that use the data from the digital twin to generate insights, predictions, and optimization strategies. It is responsible for translating raw data into actionable information and facilitating interactions between different layers of the architecture.'
userinterface: 'The user interface layer provides a means for human interaction with the digital twin ecosystem. It includes interfaces such as graphical user interfaces (GUIs), dashboards, augmented reality (AR) or virtual reality (VR) applications, and other visualization tools. This layer allows users, including operators, engineers, and managers, to monitor the state of the digital twin, access insights, and make informed decisions.'
connectivity: 'The connectivity and integration layer ensures seamless communication between the various components of the architecture. This layer facilitates data exchange between the physical twin, data layer, digital twin, service layer, user interface, and external systems. It might involve technologies such as Internet of Things (IoT) protocols, APIs (Application Programming Interfaces), middleware, and networking solutions to enable smooth and reliable data flow.'

ssh: 'The Social Science & Humanities and ethics layer focuses on the responsible and ethical use of digital twin technology including social aspects. As digital twins gather extensive data, including potentially sensitive information, ethical considerations around data privacy, security, consent, and transparency become paramount. This layer addresses ethical concerns and ensures that the implementation of digital twins respects legal and societal norms, and safeguards data and privacy.'
