The COGNIMAN Toolbox is structured according to the COGNIMAN Reference Architecture, comprising a set of different Digital Twin (DT) supporting components. These component will typically be connected and configured together in different ways for different pipeline instances in various application contexts.

As shown in the figure, seven main steps for the pipeline have been defined, corresponding to 1) Physical Twin, 2) Data Layer, 3) Digital Twin Representation, 4) Service Layer, 5) User Interface, 6) Connectivity and Intergration, and 7) SSH and Ethics.
