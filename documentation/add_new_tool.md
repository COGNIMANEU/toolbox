The COGNIMAN Toolbox is structured according to the COGNIMAN Reference Architecture which consists of seven layers.

The directories are underscore prefixed:

- [_digitaltwin](/_digitaltwin): Digital Twin 
- [_servicelayer](/_digitaltwin): Service Layer
- [_userinterface](/_userinterface): User Interface
- [_connectivity](/_connectivity): Connectivity and Intergration
- [_ssh](/_connectivity): SSH and Ethics

## Documentation Template

The **first section** of the template contains the meta-data (front matter) of the tool which will be used to present the tool in the main page of the portal. The front matter is set between the triple-dashed lines:
```
