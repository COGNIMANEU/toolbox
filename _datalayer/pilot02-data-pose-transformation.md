## Name
Pose transformation between frames

## Description
This component enables the coordinate frame transformation of a given pose state (position and orientation). It requires the source and target frames, as well as access to a tree of transformations.

### Key Features:
- Pose transformation between known frames

## Type
Tool

## Layer
Data

## HRL
- 	2.3 Autonomous navigation
-	2.6 Context & safety awareness
-	2.7 Semantic map generation

## Pilot

It facilitates the transformation of 3D poses between coordinate frames. This component allows to transform the pose of different entities and goals into a common reference frame so that the agents can fully understand and exploit this information.
