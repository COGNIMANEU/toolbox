## Name
Semantic Map Data Recorder

## Description
This service records data streams from ROS2 topics (e.g., RGB, depth, LiDAR, and pose) required for the generation of a semantic map. It enables controlled data acquisition in ROS2 environments, allowing operators to initiate and stop recording through service calls. The data gathered by this application will be able to be processed later by another application to generate the map.

### Key Features:
- Records synchronized multimodal data for semantic mapping
- Supports RGB, depth, LiDAR, and robot pose topics
- Configurable start/stop via ROS2 service interface
- Data stored in ROS bag format for post-processing
- Compatible with offline and real-time mapping workflows
