## Name
Orbital Navigation Service

## Description
This component allows controlling the trajectory of an autonomous platform, so that it performs an orbital movement around an object in the environment. The system computes the trajectory poses given a desired pose and the pose and dimensions of the object.

### Key Features:
- Orbital trajectory computation around an object
- Safe approximation maneuvers to goal poses

## Type
Tool

## Layer
Service

## HRL
- 2.1 Navigation planning
- 2.3 Autonomous navigation

## Partners

## Pilot
This component allows to create predictable and safe navigation trajectories around objects of interest, in the presence of human operators.
