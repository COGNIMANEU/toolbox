## Name
Autonomous Navigation Library

## Description
This component provides all the necessary elements for navigating safely to a goal pose with a robotic platform. The specific kinematic model, the global planner and the local controller, among other configuration parameters, can be defined according to the requirements of the navigation task.

### Key Features:
- Based in the ROS2 navigation library Nav2
- Allows to reach desired poses with different kinds of autonomous platforms
- Includes all the necessary modules for navigation, including mapping, localization, planning, etc.
- Highly configurable
