### Key Features:

- Image-based positioning system
- Infrastructure-free operation (no GPS or external anchors required)
- QR code-based product identification
- Trust-ability scoring to ensure the reliability of position data

## Type
Tool

## Layer
Service

## HRL
- 4.2.1 Real position of batches, introducing the Y dimension (ground clearance of the bar) 

## Partners
NORCE

## Pilot
This component allows positioning of batches in outdoor stacks using front images captured by drones. 
The system autonomously scans a designated area, detects QR codes for product identification, and calculates the spatial relationships between batches.
