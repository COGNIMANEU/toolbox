## Name
Safety rules support (triangle)

## Description
The system must be able to recognize the shape of the bar (round), wedges, etc. (ABS Pilot)

This tool is designed to automatically detect triangular safety support elements placed near stacked steel bars using top-view imagery. These supports play a critical role in securing the bars in place and ensuring structural safety in storage environments, such as those found in the ABS Pilot.

The system processes top-down camera views to identify the distinctive triangular shapes of the supports, verifying their presence and correct positioning around the bar stacks. Using geometric detection methods, the tool operates without requiring annotated training data, enabling scalable and real-time safety validation.

It is optimized to handle visual challenges such as background clutter, lighting changes, and partial occlusion, making it suitable for deployment in real-world industrial settings. The tool contributes to reducing manual inspection workloads and enhances safety assurance by automating the detection of physical safety structures.
